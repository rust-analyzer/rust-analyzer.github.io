* pr:3490[] support aliases and Self in struct literals.
* pr:3494[] implement `include!` macro.
* pr:3499[] resolve `Self::AssocTy` in impls.
* pr:3516[] account for visibility during code completion.
* pr:3514[] flag to update the server binary automatically, without asking.

== Fixes

* pr:3378[] fix inlay hints to work correctly in VS Code for several opened editors.
* pr:3388[] don't show wrong inlay hints in a diff view.
* pr:3430[] use correct name when completing re-exported functions.
* pr:3509[] disallow `include!` macro to include itself.
* pr:3520[] don't show trivial type hints for unit structs.
* pr:3526[] silence "Rust file outside current workspace" warning.


== Internal Improvements

* pr:3502[] don't cache Chalk solver. Counter-intuitively, this allows improves performance by allowing caching elsewhere.
* pr:3405[], pr:3427[], pr:3428[] refactor reference and definitions to better accommodate edge cases like field init shorthand.
* pr:3440[], pr:3426[], pr:3443[] refactor reference search infrastructure.
* pr:3413[] update chalk.
* pr:3425[] fix macro expansion for a single dollar.
* pr:3458[] add `cargo xtask dist` for building the distribution package.
* pr:3489[] make sure that during expression lowering every non-missing expression gets a source.
* pr:3487[] add some editing API for manipulating use statements.
* pr:3497[] specify additional label on profiling calls, to see, for example, which functions are slow to typecheck.
