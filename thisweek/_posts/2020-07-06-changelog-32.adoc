Release: release:2020-07-06[]

== Sponsors

This week we'd like to thank one of our individual sponsors, https://github.com/anp[@anp].

@anp maintains https://moxie.rs[moxie] project: a lightweight platform-agnostic declarative UI runtime, because incremental feedback latency and quality are core to building interactive software.


**Become a sponsor:** https://opencollective.com/rust-analyzer/[opecollective.com/rust-analyzer]

== New Features

* pr:5169[], pr:5188[] initial support for dynamic workspace reloading.

* pr:5119[] show notification while SSR is in progress.
* pr:5120[], pr:5154[] add a simple SSR subcommand to the rust-analyzer command line binary:
[source,bash]
----
rust-analyzer ssr '$a.foo($b) ==> bar($a, $b)'
----
* pr:5161[] add initial support for placeholder constraints in structural search replace.
* pr:5142[] allow parallel type inference in batch mode (`rust-analyzer analysis-stats`).
* pr:5178[] emit folding ranges for multiline calls.
* pr:5149[] implement Chalk variable kinds, which improves type inference for primitives.
* pr:5116[] set categories for code actions.
* pr:5192[] take `rust-analyzer.cargo.features` into account when generating run configurations.
* pr:5202[] allow to set default environment for run configurations:
+
```jsonc
"rust-analyzer.runnableEnv": [
  {
    // null mask means that this rule will be applied for all runnables
    // "mask": null,
    env: {
      "APP_ID": "1",
      "APP_DATA": "asdf"
    }
  },
  {
    "mask": "test_name",
    "env": {
      "APP_ID": "2", // overwrites only APP_ID
    }
  }
]
```
* pr:4864[] Add optional target to crates in json project

== Fixes

* pr:5122[] fix "Run | Debug" lens for examples.
* pr:5124[] partially fix handling of type params depending on type params.
* pr:5211[] partially fix inference of indexing argument.
* pr:5096[] fix handling of whitespace when applying SSR within macro expansions.
* pr:5110[] fix call hierarchy.
* pr:5179[] lower fields despite invalid type.
* pr:5089[] disable auto-complete on comments.
* pr:5189[] record and suggest assoc. items of traits via ImportMap.
* pr:5212[] fix renaming of nested out of line modules `mod outer { mod inner; }`.

== Internal Improvements

* pr:5136[] split namespace maps in `ItemScope`, reducing memory usage of the CrateDefMap query by ~130 MB (50%) on r-a.
* pr:5175[] more memory-efficient impl collection.
  This saves roughly 90 MB in `ImplsFromDepsQuery`, which used to copy the list of all impls from libcore into *every* crate in the graph.
* pr:5127[] improve test infra for type inference test.
* pr:5126[] use `FxHash{Map,Set}` consistently.
* pr:5101[] add expect -- a lighter-weight alternative to the `insta` snapshot testing library.
* pr:5137[] make gotodef tests more data-driven.
* pr:5138[] refactor runnable tests.
* pr:5146[], pr:5151[] simplify inlay hints tests.
* pr:5153[], pr:5156[], pr:5157[], pr:5162[] remove some generics from `ra_hir` interface.
* pr:5158[] correctly distinguish between semantical and display crate names.
* pr:5160[], pr:5167[] reuse caches in more cases.
* pr:5176[] update expand macro tests.
* pr:5193[] move `cargo metadata` off the main loop.
* pr:5199[], pr:5200[], pr:5201[], pr:5205[], pr:5214[], pr:5215[], pr:5219[], pr:5221[], pr:5226[] refactor completion tests.
* pr:5197[] SSR internal refactors.
* pr:5222[] add "rehighlight after adding a new top-level function" to the set of bechmarks.
