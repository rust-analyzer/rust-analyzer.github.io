Release: release:2020-04-20[]

== New Features

* pr:3958[] Initial support for proc-macros
+

+
To enable it, set the following settings:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.loadOutDirsFromCheck": true,
    "rust-analyzer.procMacro.enabled": true
}
----

* pr:3990[] switch to Chalk recursive solver.
  This significantly improves type inference when associated types are involved,
  for example, with iterators:

* pr:4034[] add `unresolvedReference` semantic tag for names which rust-analyzer fails to resolve.
  Adding to VS Code config
+
[source,json]
----
"editor.tokenColorCustomizationsExperimental": {
    "unresolvedReference": "#FF0000"
}
----
+
will give fast feedback about unresolved references, highlighting them in red.
No default highlighting is set, as rust-analyzer still has a fair number of false positives.

* pr:3962[] don't assign shortcut for **Parent Module** command.
  The original shortcut was kbd:[ctrl+u], but it conflicts with VS Code build-in.
  It is recommended to assign custom shortcut for `rust-analyzer.parentModule` action.
* pr:3965[] implement inline associated type bounds.
* pr:3966[] add support for bounds on associated types in trait definitions.
* pr:4026[] omit more parameter hints in the presence of underscores.
* pr:3894[] implement exhaustiveness checking for record enum variants.

== Fixes

* pr:3961[] fix extraneous comma when merging import.
* pr:3969[] **Add Function** assist now uses `todo!` macro.
* pr:3967[] handle `Self::Type` in trait definitions when referring to own associated type.
* pr:3948[] fix inlay hints config synchronization between client and server.
* pr:3979[] fix missing match arm false positive for enum with no variants.
* pr:4010[] fix diagnostics ranges in macros.
* pr:4011[] fix self-fulfilling completion.
* pr:4012[] fix panic on ellipsis in pattern.
* pr:4021[] fix type equality for dyn Trait.
* pr:4022[] fix panic in syntax highlighting.
* pr:4023[] fix another crash from wrong binders.
* pr:4027[] don't qualify builtins in generated code.
* pr:4036[] fix name resolution in guard closes and record patterns.

== Internal Improvements

* pr:3971[] add `rust-analyzer diagnostics` command for batch processing.
* pr:3964[] nicer Chalk debug logs.
* pr:3994[], pr:4016[] don't expose implementation details of `SyntaxNodePtr`.
* pr:3995[] separate project discovery from project loading.
* pr:4008[] add more info about what failed in tidy tests.
