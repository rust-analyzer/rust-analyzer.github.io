Release: release:2020-03-02[]

== New Features

* pr:3159[], pr:3321[], pr:3322[] switch syntax highlighting implementation to use the new proposed semantic token LSP/VS Code API.To try this out:
** install vscode plugin from source (using `cargo xtask install --client-code`)
** set `"rust-analyzer.highlighting.semanticTokens": true,` in settings,
** install the recent VS Code Insiders
** run `code` as `code-insiders --enable-proposed-api matklad.rust-analyzer` (handy https://github.com/matklad/config/blob/0864beea2f19b9130ac1349c74a2b255df2fb0e8/bin/code[bash wrapper])

* pr:3362[] remove kbd:[ctrl+r] default keybinding for running tests & binaries, to avoid conflict with a build-in keybinding.
  You might want to assign shortcut for this action, it is a productivity booster!

* pr:3294[] when joining lines, unwrap single-statement blocks if possible.
* pr:3285[] structural search replace now correctly ignores whitespace differences.
* pr:3357[] **change visibility** assist now works with consts:

* pr:3355[] add completion & docs for `featureFlag` configuration in VS Code extension.
* pr:3309[] look for `Cargo.toml` not only in the root and parent directory, but also among one-level child directories.
* pr:3387[] type inference for slice patterns.
* pr:3397[] add minimal metadata to VS Code extension.

== Fixes

* pr:3314[], pr:3325[], pr:3350[], pr:3366[] fix a lot of range-mapping bugs for recursive macro invocations.
* pr:3308[] fix conflict for `Enter` key with VS Code vim extension.
  If rust-analyzer's custom on enter behavior causes you trouble, you can disable it by removing the corresponding shortcut from the settings.
* pr:3364[] correctly handle unions in IDEs.
* pr:3367[] finally fix highlighting and name goto definition for constants in patterns, like `None`.
* pr:3376[] fix a common false-positive type mismatch.
* pr:3380[] use unsizing in method resolution & autoderef for indexing.
* pr:3384[] fix name resolution for paths with repeated `super` segments.

== Internal Improvements

* pr:3222[] redo the interface between "compiler" and "IDE".
  IDE no longer needs to explicitly track the file a particular bit of syntax tree originated from.
* pr:3296[] bump TypeScript version.
* pr:3299[] more type safe way to deal with custom LSP extensions.
* pr:3298[] update chalk.
* pr:3316[] remove code duplication in assists tests.
* pr:3324[], pr:3335[], pr:3344[], pr:3346[] refactor syntax highlighting infrastructure to be more future proof and robust.
* pr:3329[], pr:3330[] run `cargo audit` and `npm audit` on CI.
* pr:3337[] remove unused dependencies.
* pr:3340[] gate CI on eslint.
* pr:3351[] better API for working with string literals.
* pr:3360[] fix parsing of attributes in let statements.
* pr:3370[] extract code for adding a new `use` item to a separate module.
* pr:3374[] cleanup API for constructing syntax trees for paths.
* pr:3375[] cleanup API for editing syntax trees.
* pr:3377[] simplify API for getting semantic definitions from syntax trees.
