Hello!

This is the first instance of a monthly changelog for rust-analyzer. Notable
changes since last month include:

== New Features

* pr:1558[] initial support for `.await` syntax.
- pr:1512[] type inference for `?`.
- pr:1472[] completion for type aliases.
- pr:1544[], pr:1550[] mutable variables are underlined.
- pr:1476[] `add_impl_members` adds types.
- pr:1478[], pr:1499[] submodules with raw names and `#[path]` are resolved.
- pr:1496[] correctly add obligations in function methods.
- pr:1501[] initial type inference for `for` loops.
- pr:1515[] use bounds on generic parameters during type inference.
- pr:1525[], pr:1572[] completions works for fields of enum variants and in patterns.
- pr:1582[] show types of local variables in completion.

== Fixes

- pr:1511[] make goto definition work with various Vim clients.
- pr:1494[] diagnostics are collected for a single file.
- pr:1536[] show code lens for `fn main`.
- pr:1514[] fix discovery of lang items.

== Internal Improvements

- pr:1575[] s the lexer with rustc.
- pr:1545[] migrate to the new version of rowan library, improving memory usage of syntax trees for 60%.
- pr:1532[] pick up floundering work from chalk.
- Many improvements and cleanups by https://github.com/kjeremy[@kjeremy].


The highlight of the month is probably pr:1575[].
The end-game for rust-analyzer is to become a different front-end for the code that rustc itself uses.
This pull request is the first step on this path: now, rust-analyzer and rustc use the same code for lexing Rust.
