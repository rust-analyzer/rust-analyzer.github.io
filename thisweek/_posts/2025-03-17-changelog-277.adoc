Commit: commit:b0632f749e6abf0f82f71755d7eaca4884c1a808[] +
Release: release:2025-03-17[] (`v0.3.2345`)

== Announcement

This release brings two major changes, which might make it slightly _spicier_ than usual.

The first is upgrading to the latest version of `salsa`, the incremental evaluation framework used by rust-analyzer.
This will make it possible to implement parallel evaluation and persistency in the future.

The second change is to use `salsa` for the crate graph, making it incremental.
Adding or removing a dependency, or editing a build script or proc macro, will now invalidate only the affected crates instead of the entire workspace.

== New Features
