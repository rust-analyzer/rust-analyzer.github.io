Commit: commit:ec3fb1cdb4f1808a11fb6057550ed721c2aa36a9[] +
Release: release:2020-04-06[]

== New Features

* **BREAKING** pr:3824[] changed the name of many options. The current set is specified https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/ec3fb1cdb4f1808a11fb6057550ed721c2aa36a9/editors/code/package.json#L176-L390[here]. If you are using a non-VS Code client, note that rust-analyzer now asks for
`rust-analyzer` section of configuration, and expects this config to be present in `initializationOptions`.

* pr:3804[], pr:3825[] it is now possible to use arbitrary command for on the fly error checking:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.overrideCommand": [
        "./x.py", "check", "--json-output"
    ]
}
----
* pr:3807[], pr:3825[] similarly, it is now possible to completely override `rustfmt` command.

* pr:3820[] remove support for old syntax highlighting. To use the new semantic tokens highlighting:
. install the recent vscode insiders build
. add
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "rust-analyzer.highlighting.semanticTokens": true,
    "editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": false,
}
----
+
to config
. run vscode as `code-insiders --enabled-proposed-api matklad.rust-analyzer`
. make sure to use a color theme with support for syntax highlighitng.
. Rust specific tokens and modifiers are listed https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/ec3fb1cdb4f1808a11fb6057550ed721c2aa36a9/editors/code/package.json#L489-L531[here]. For example, to underline all `mut` and `&mut` variables, add this to `settings.json`:
+
[source,json]
----
"editor.tokenColorCustomizationsExperimental": {
    "*.mutable": {
        "fontStyle": "underline"
    }
}
----

* pr:3814[] add **Implement From for enum variant** assist

* pr:3777[] populate default task list in VS Code with cargo commands.
* pr:3765[] SSR no longer takes field order into account.
* pr:3829[] SSR treats method call and UFCS equivalently.

== Fixes

* pr:3785[] attach doc comments to declaration even if there's a blank line after comment.
* pr:3781[], pr:3819[] make **Run** action correctly handle the case with several major versions of the package in the crate graph.

* pr:3858[] don't show return type for `()`-returning function.

== Internal Improvements

* pr:3817[], pr:3815[], pr:3816[] **Show Syntax Tree** internal command now has syntax highlighting and auto scroll from source.
* pr:3805[], pr:3806[], pr:3811[] lower literal patterns.
* pr:3790[] use uniiform naming (`config`) for all configuration-related functionality.
* pr:3792[], pr:3802[] inspired by Emacs, rename "cargo watch" functionality to flycheck.

* pr:3795[] decouple flycheck and project model.
* pr:3809[] reduce the number of structs holding configuration from three to one.
* pr:3836[] wrap macros in pattern position into `ast::MacroPat` node to not confuse them with expressions.
* pr:3744[] upgrade chalk.
