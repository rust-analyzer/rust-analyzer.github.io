* pr:4082[] implement `rust-analyzer --help`.
* pr:4090[] fix naming of two config options:

* pr:4092[] allow running `#[ignore]` tests.
* pr:4107[] custom `onEnter` command is disabled by default. To re-enable it, use the following config:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "key": "Enter",
    "command": "rust-analyzer.onEnter",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && !suggestWidgetVisible && editorLangId == rust"
},
----
* pr:4111[] support for `extern "C" {}` blocks.
* pr:3998[] **Add Function** assist can now add functions in other files.
* pr:4133[] eagerly prime caches to reduce startup latency in certain vim setups.
