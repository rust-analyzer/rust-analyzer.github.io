Commit: commit:c57ed0cfb29bc2b311299eebb4f7820a31068a37[] +
Release: release:2020-02-03[]

== New Features

* pr:2963[] add auto-import support to Emacs.
* pr:2978[] support auto-import for functions.
* pr:2982[] merge imports when auto-importing.

== Fixes

* pr:2933[] don't compute diagnostics on the main thread.
  That fixes a long-standing issue with performance degradation due to `cargo check`.
* pr:2810[] make magical search of struct literals work in more contexts.
* pr:2916[] fix slow `cargo check` performance due to unbuffered reads.
* pr:2924[] avoid spawning more than one Cargo for `cargo check`.
* pr:2917[] prefer imports starting with `std` for auto import.
* pr:2937[] fix an issue where `cargo check` got stuck in an infinite loop if some procedural macro printed to stdout.
* pr:2970[] fix some clint-side bugs with syntax highlighting.
* pr:2972[], a fun one, prevent a child process for flipping rust-analyzer's stdin into non-blocking mode.
* pr:2959[] fix a bug where diagnostics from `cargo check` were obsolete.

== Internal Improvements

* pr:2872[] update Chalk. This should fix some cases of extremely slow trait checking.
* pr:2934[] log error if the main loop turns takes too long.
* pr:2931[] document `test_utils` module.
* pr:2940[], pr:2941[] update developer documentation.
* pr:2943[] improve memory usage tracking infrastructure.
* pr:2895[] make internal profiling infrastructure more maintainable.
* pr:2967[] speed up the build of rust-analyzer by using profile overrides.
* pr:2987[], pr:2986[], pr:2989[] cleanup VS Code extension.
* pr:2991[], pr:2998[] unsuccessfully try to improve TypeScript build process.
