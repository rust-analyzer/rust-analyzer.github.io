== A Message from the Team

We of the rust-analyzer team never took the opportunity to introduce ourselves, but we want to make an exception because of the current events.

One of the early rust-analyzer contributors is currently in Kyiv, amidst falling missiles and artillery shells.

Our friend did not ask for this, did not ask to be liberated or saved by the Russian Army.
Neither did the other countless Ukrainians who are today at risk.
Their fault is having been born in a country which a bully decided shouldn't exist.

In Ukraine, Putin's army is committing war crimes, while those at home have no idea because independent journalism has been outlawed.

So please, speak up.
If you have friends or family in Russia, call and tell them what millions of people.
And consider https://mobile.twitter.com/Ukraine/status/1497294840110977024[making a donation] or going to a protest.

Thank you and _Slava Ukraini!_

== Heads-up

The latest Visual Studio Code version (1.65, released on March 3) has native support for inlay hints.
We have been using a custom implementation of that, but would like to switch to the upstream one in pr:11445[], planned to be merged next week.
This means that the next release will require VS Code 1.65.

Unfortunately, the upstream implementation brings some regressions.
Specifically, the caret behaves differently when passing over the hint, and the styling is not necessarily better.
In addition, Code only updates the hints about four times per second while typing, causing them to feel more sluggish.
