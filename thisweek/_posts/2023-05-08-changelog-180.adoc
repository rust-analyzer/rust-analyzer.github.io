* pr:14662[] (first contribution) support locally-built documentation for `experimental/externalDocs` with compatible clients.
* pr:14664[] MIR episode 4, support arithmetic assignment operators, statics, constants in patterns and associated constants in traits.
* pr:14711[] highlight closure captures when cursor is on `|` or `move`.
* pr:14732[] fix pattern type mismatches for bindings, enable pattern type mismatch diagnostics again.
* pr:14725[] emit function bodies when expanding built-in derives.
* pr:14749[] define problem matcher for panics, kbd:[F8] will go to the panic location in Code.
* pr:14758[] add `rust-analyzer.hover.memoryLayout.enable` config for disabling memory layout info on hover.

== Fixes

* pr:14745[] (first contribution) sort dependencies in VS Code tree view.
* pr:14707[] don't generate already-existing methods on `generate_delegate_methods`.
* pr:14713[] don't highlight escapes in raw strings.
* pr:14714[] exclude `Sized` from go-to actions in hover.

* pr:14712[] only pass unstable flags to `cargo metadata` from extra args config.
* pr:14738[] use block def maps in body lowering.
* pr:14739[] parse bare dyn types with leading lifetime.
* pr:14750[] ignore impls with `#[rustc_reservation_impl]`
* pr:14748[] show memory layout type aliases.

== Internal Improvements

* pr:14716[] reduce memory consumption by not merging `trait_impls_in_deps` results (saves 59 MB on `self`).
* pr:14720[] use boxed slices instead of ``Vec``s in declarative macros (saves 8 MB on `self`).
* pr:14718[] use `triomphe::Arc` instead of `std::sync::Arc` (saves 4 MB on `self`).
* pr:14715[] refactor symbol index.
* pr:14710[] refactor notification handlers.
* pr:14733[] publish `line-index` and switch to `nohash_hasher`.
* pr:14757[] fix library publish branch filter.
