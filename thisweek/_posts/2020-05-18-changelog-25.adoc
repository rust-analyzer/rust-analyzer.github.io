* pr:4436[] use `.rust` sufix on TextMate scopes introduced by rust-analyzer for easier theming.
* pr:4427[] use Ubuntu 16.04 to build releases, to get older glibc.
* pr:4400[], pr:4473[] improve syntax higlighting, underline mutable bindings in all themes.
* pr:4455[] in completion, prioritise locals with correct types.
* pr:4288[] initial implementation of renaming of `self` parameter, for switching between associated function and a method.
* pr:4479[], pr:4484[] support for `dyn Trait`.
* pr:4489[] reduce allocations, improving performance for batch analysis for up to 4%.
* pr:4496[] we now support two latest versions of VS Code.

== Fixes

* pr:4421[] fix visibility handling in find references.
* pr:4403[] check client capabilities before sending progres notifications.
* pr:4447[] make sure that play arrow in `Run` lens is not emoji-ifyied.
* pr:4431[] don't garbage-collect results of procedural macro expansion, to combat non-deterministic proc macros.
  Please avoid randomized hash maps when writing procedural macros :-)
* pr:4470[] handle `Self` in values and patterns.
* pr:4472[] fix path resolution for module and function with same name.

== Internal Improvements

* pr:4424[] use `RA_LOG` variable to enable rust-analyzer's logging, so as not to conflict with usual `RUST_LOG`.
* pr:4083[] document rust-analyzer's AST.
* pr:4405[] make some internal types public so that rust-analyzer is easier to use as a library.
