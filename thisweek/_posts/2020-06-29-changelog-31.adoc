Release: release:2020-06-29[]

== Sponsors

This week, we'd like to thank another long-time sponsor:

https://www.parity.io/[Parity] is building tooling and infrastructure for the decentralised, trustless Web in Rust.

== New Features

* pr:4990[] introduce an `ItemTree` layer to avoid reparsing files.
  This reduces the latency of "go to definition" in a simple benchmark on rust-analyzer by around 30%.
* pr:5017[] add custom cargo runners support. This adds an option to delegate actual cargo commands building to another extension.
  For example, to use a different manager like https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross[cross].
  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsrs.cross-rust-analyzer[cross-rust-analyzer] is an example of such extension.
* pr:5069[] **Extract Variable** understands field init shorthand

* pr:4999[] allow matching of whole macro calls in structural search replace.
* pr:5007[] allow matching within macro calls in structural search replace.
* pr:4997[] document GNOME Builder (Nightly) support for rust-analyzer.
* pr:4940[] set `injected` modifier for code in doctests.
  Theme authors can use it to dim injected code.
* pr:5047[] matching brace works for | in lambdas

* pr:5066[] infer type for slice wildcard patterns.
* pr:4587[] missing unsafe diagnostics.
* pr:5100[], pr:5102[]: Add support for `include_str` and `include_bytes`.

== Fixes

* pr:4900[] fix name resolution for `Self` in enums.
* pr:4988[] don't offer to add missing fields of unknown types.
* pr:4992[] never disable error logging on the frontend.
* pr:5002[] fix underflow panic when doctests are at top of file.
* pr:5004[] fix panic in split/merge import assists.
* pr:5023[] fix string literal inference in match.
* pr:5015[] account for updated module ids when determining whether a resolution is changed.
* pr:5033[] order of glob imports does not affect import shadowing.

== Internal Improvements

* pr:4976[] new VFS.
* pr:5068[] prepare for dynamic project reloading.
* Rewrite main loop in rust-analyzer.
* pr:4982[] upgrade chalk. This, and other type system improvements, bring the proportion of of unknown types in rust-analyzer to less than 1%.
* pr:4983[], pr:5010[] add `paths::RelPath[Buf]`.
* pr:5013[] uniformly trim test data.
* pr:5014[] centralize test data parsing.
* pr:5029[] use `paths::AbsPath` in more places.
* pr:5034[] cleanup project.json deserialization.
* pr:5048[], pr:5056[] Canonicalize actor API.
