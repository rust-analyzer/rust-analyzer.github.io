=== Auto Import
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide_assists/src/handlers/auto_import.rs#L10[auto_import.rs]

Using the `auto-import` assist it is possible to insert missing imports for unresolved items.
When inserting an import it will do so in a structured manner by keeping imports grouped,
separated by a newline in the following order:

- `std` and `core`
- External Crates
- Current Crate, paths prefixed by `crate`
- Current Module, paths prefixed by `self`
- Super Module, paths prefixed by `super`

Example:
```rust
use std::fs::File;

use itertools::Itertools;
use syntax::ast;

use crate::utils::insert_use;

use self::auto_import;

use super::AssistContext;
```

.Import Granularity

It is possible to configure how use-trees are merged with the `importGranularity` setting.
It has the following configurations:

- `crate`: Merge imports from the same crate into a single use statement. This kind of
 nesting is only supported in Rust versions later than 1.24.
- `module`: Merge imports from the same module into a single use statement.
- `item`: Don't merge imports at all, creating one import per item.
- `preserve`: Do not change the granularity of any imports. For auto-import this has the same
 effect as `item`.

In `VS Code` the configuration for this is `rust-analyzer.assist.importGranularity`.

.Import Prefix

The style of imports in the same crate is configurable through the `importPrefix` setting.
It has the following configurations:

- `by_crate`: This setting will force paths to be always absolute, starting with the `crate`
 prefix, unless the item is defined outside of the current crate.
- `by_self`: This setting will force paths that are relative to the current module to always
 start with `self`. This will result in paths that always start with either `crate`, `self`,
 `super` or an extern crate identifier.
- `plain`: This setting does not impose any restrictions in imports.

In `VS Code` the configuration for this is `rust-analyzer.assist.importPrefix`.

=== Completion With Autoimport
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide_completion/src/completions/flyimport.rs#L17[flyimport.rs]

When completing names in the current scope, proposes additional imports from other modules or crates,
if they can be qualified in the scope, and their name contains all symbols from the completion input.

To be considered applicable, the name must contain all input symbols in the given order, not necessarily adjacent.
If any input symbol is not lowercased, the name must contain all symbols in exact case; otherwise the containing is checked case-insensitively.

```
fn main() {
    pda$0
}
# pub mod std { pub mod marker { pub struct PhantomData { } } }
```
->
```
use std::marker::PhantomData;

fn main() {
    PhantomData
}
# pub mod std { pub mod marker { pub struct PhantomData { } } }
```

Also completes associated items, that require trait imports.
If any unresolved and/or partially-qualified path precedes the input, it will be taken into account.
Currently, only the imports with their import path ending with the whole qualifier will be proposed
(no fuzzy matching for qualifier).

```
mod foo {
    pub mod bar {
        pub struct Item;

        impl Item {
            pub const TEST_ASSOC: usize = 3;
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    bar::Item::TEST_A$0
}
```
->
```
use foo::bar;

mod foo {
    pub mod bar {
        pub struct Item;

        impl Item {
            pub const TEST_ASSOC: usize = 3;
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    bar::Item::TEST_ASSOC
}
```

NOTE: currently, if an assoc item comes from a trait that's not currently imported, and it also has an unresolved and/or partially-qualified path,
no imports will be proposed.

.Fuzzy search details

To avoid an excessive amount of the results returned, completion input is checked for inclusion in the names only
(i.e. in `HashMap` in the `std::collections::HashMap` path).
For the same reasons, avoids searching for any path imports for inputs with their length less than 2 symbols
(but shows all associated items for any input length).

.Import configuration

It is possible to configure how use-trees are merged with the `importMergeBehavior` setting.
Mimics the corresponding behavior of the `Auto Import` feature.

.LSP and performance implications

The feature is enabled only if the LSP client supports LSP protocol version 3.16+ and reports the `additionalTextEdits`
(case-sensitive) resolve client capability in its client capabilities.
This way the server is able to defer the costly computations, doing them for a selected completion item only.
For clients with no such support, all edits have to be calculated on the completion request, including the fuzzy search completion ones,
which might be slow ergo the feature is automatically disabled.

.Feature toggle

The feature can be forcefully turned off in the settings with the `rust-analyzer.completion.autoimport.enable` flag.
Note that having this flag set to `true` does not guarantee that the feature is enabled: your client needs to have the corresponding
capability enabled.

rust-analyzer shows additional information inline with the source code.
Editors usually render this using read-only virtual text snippets interspersed with code.

rust-analyzer shows hints for

* types of local variables
* names of function arguments
* types of chained expressions

**Note:** VS Code does not have native support for inlay hints https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/16221[yet] and the hints are implemented using decorations.
This approach has limitations, the caret movement and bracket highlighting near the edges of the hint may be weird:

=== Magic Completions
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide_completion/src/lib.rs#L37[lib.rs]

In addition to usual reference completion, rust-analyzer provides some ✨magic✨
completions as well:

Keywords like `if`, `else` `while`, `loop` are completed with braces, and cursor
is placed at the appropriate position. Even though `if` is easy to type, you
still want to complete it, to get ` { }` for free! `return` is inserted with a
space or `;` depending on the return type of the function.

When completing a function call, `()` are automatically inserted. If a function
takes arguments, the cursor is positioned inside the parenthesis.

There are postfix completions, which can be triggered by typing something like
`foo().if`. The word after `.` determines postfix completion. Possible variants are:

- `expr.if` -> `if expr {}` or `if let ... {}` for `Option` or `Result`
- `expr.match` -> `match expr {}`
- `expr.while` -> `while expr {}` or `while let ... {}` for `Option` or `Result`
- `expr.ref` -> `&expr`
- `expr.refm` -> `&mut expr`
- `expr.let` -> `let $0 = expr;`
- `expr.letm` -> `let mut $0 = expr;`
- `expr.not` -> `!expr`
- `expr.dbg` -> `dbg!(expr)`
- `expr.dbgr` -> `dbg!(&expr)`
- `expr.call` -> `(expr)`

There also snippet completions:

.Expressions
- `pd` -> `eprintln!(" = {:?}", );`
- `ppd` -> `eprintln!(" = {:#?}", );`

.Items
- `tfn` -> `#[test] fn feature(){}`
- `tmod` ->
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_name() {}
}
```

And the auto import completions, enabled with the `rust-analyzer.completion.autoimport.enable` setting and the corresponding LSP client capabilities.
Those are the additional completion options with automatic `use` import and options from all project importable items,
fuzzy matched against the completion input.

=== Matching Brace
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide/src/matching_brace.rs#L6[matching_brace.rs]

If the cursor is on any brace (`<>(){}[]||`) which is a part of a brace-pair,
moves cursor to the matching brace. It uses the actual parser to determine
braces, so it won't confuse generics with comparisons.

**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide/src/typing/on_enter.rs#L16[on_enter.rs]

rust-analyzer can override kbd:[Enter] key to make it smarter:

- kbd:[Enter] inside triple-slash comments automatically inserts `///`
- kbd:[Enter] in the middle or after a trailing space in `//` inserts `//`
- kbd:[Enter] inside `//!` doc comments automatically inserts `//!`
- kbd:[Enter] after `{` indents contents and closing `}` of single-line block

This action needs to be assigned to shortcut explicitly.

=== Semantic Syntax Highlighting
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide/src/syntax_highlighting.rs#L42[syntax_highlighting.rs]

rust-analyzer highlights the code semantically.
For example, `Bar` in `foo::Bar` might be colored differently depending on whether `Bar` is an enum or a trait.
rust-analyzer does not specify colors directly, instead it assigns a tag (like `struct`) and a set of modifiers (like `declaration`) to each token.
It's up to the client to map those to specific colors.

The general rule is that a reference to an entity gets colored the same way as the entity itself.
We also give special modifier for `mut` and `&mut` local variables.

=== Structural Search and Replace
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide_ssr/src/lib.rs#L6[lib.rs]

Search and replace with named wildcards that will match any expression, type, path, pattern or item.
The syntax for a structural search replace command is `<search_pattern> ==>> <replace_pattern>`.
A `$<name>` placeholder in the search pattern will match any AST node and `$<name>` will reference it in the replacement.
Within a macro call, a placeholder will match up until whatever token follows the placeholder.

All paths in both the search pattern and the replacement template must resolve in the context
in which this command is invoked. Paths in the search pattern will then match the code if they
resolve to the same item, even if they're written differently. For example if we invoke the
command in the module `foo` with a pattern of `Bar`, then code in the parent module that refers
to `foo::Bar` will match.

Paths in the replacement template will be rendered appropriately for the context in which the
replacement occurs. For example if our replacement template is `foo::Bar` and we match some
code in the `foo` module, we'll insert just `Bar`.

Inherent method calls should generally be written in UFCS form. e.g. `foo::Bar::baz($s, $a)` will
match `$s.baz($a)`, provided the method call `baz` resolves to the method `foo::Bar::baz`. When a
placeholder is the receiver of a method call in the search pattern (e.g. `$s.foo()`), but not in
the replacement template (e.g. `bar($s)`), then *, & and &mut will be added as needed to mirror
whatever autoderef and autoref was happening implicitly in the matched code.

The scope of the search / replace will be restricted to the current selection if any, otherwise
it will apply to the whole workspace.

Placeholders may be given constraints by writing them as `${<name>:<constraint1>:<constraint2>...}`.

Supported constraints:

|===
| Constraint    | Restricts placeholder

| kind(literal) | Is a literal (e.g. `42` or `"forty two"`)
| not(a)        | Negates the constraint `a`
|===

Available via the command `rust-analyzer.ssr`.

```rust
// Using structural search replace command [foo($a, $b) ==>> ($a).foo($b)]

// BEFORE
String::from(foo(y + 5, z))

// AFTER
String::from((y + 5).foo(z))
```

Also available as an assist, by writing a comment containing the structural
search and replace rule. You will only see the assist if the comment can
be parsed as a valid structural search and replace rule.

```rust
// Place the cursor on the line below to see the assist 💡.
// foo($a, $b) ==>> ($a).foo($b)
```


=== User Snippet Completions
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide_completion/src/snippet.rs#L7[snippet.rs]

rust-analyzer allows the user to define custom (postfix)-snippets that may depend on items to be accessible for the current scope to be applicable.

A custom snippet can be defined by adding it to the `rust-analyzer.completion.snippets` object respectively.

[source,json]
----
{
  "rust-analyzer.completion.snippets": {
    "thread spawn": {
      "prefix": ["spawn", "tspawn"],
      "body": [
        "thread::spawn(move || {",
        "\t$0",
        ")};",
      ],
      "description": "Insert a thread::spawn call",
      "requires": "std::thread",
      "scope": "expr",
    }
  }
}
----

In the example above:

* `"thread spawn"` is the name of the snippet.

* `prefix` defines one or more trigger words that will trigger the snippets completion.
Using `postfix` will instead create a postfix snippet.

* `body` is one or more lines of content joined via newlines for the final output.

* `description` is an optional description of the snippet, if unset the snippet name will be used.

* `requires` is an optional list of item paths that have to be resolvable in the current crate where the completion is rendered.
On failure of resolution the snippet won't be applicable, otherwise the snippet will insert an import for the items on insertion if
the items aren't yet in scope.

* `scope` is an optional filter for when the snippet should be applicable. Possible values are:
** for Snippet-Scopes: `expr`, `item` (default: `item`)
** for Postfix-Snippet-Scopes: `expr`, `type` (default: `expr`)

The `body` field also has access to placeholders as visible in the example as `$0`.
These placeholders take the form of `$number` or `${number:placeholder_text}` which can be traversed as tabstop in ascending order starting from 1,
with `$0` being a special case that always comes last.

There is also a special placeholder, `${receiver}`, which will be replaced by the receiver expression for postfix snippets, or nothing in case of normal snippets.
It does not act as a tabstop.


=== View Crate Graph
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide/src/view_crate_graph.rs#L10[view_crate_graph.rs]

Renders the currently loaded crate graph as an SVG graphic. Requires the `dot` tool, which
is part of graphviz, to be installed.

Only workspace crates are included, no crates.io dependencies or sysroot crates.

=== Workspace Symbol
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide_db/src/symbol_index.rs#L148[symbol_index.rs]

Uses fuzzy-search to find types, modules and functions by name across your
project and dependencies. This is **the** most useful feature, which improves code
navigation tremendously. It mostly works on top of the built-in LSP
functionality, however `#` and `*` symbols can be used to narrow down the
search. Specifically,

- `Foo` searches for `Foo` type in the current workspace
- `foo#` searches for `foo` function in the current workspace
- `Foo*` searches for `Foo` type among dependencies, including `stdlib`
- `foo#*` searches for `foo` function among dependencies

That is, `#` switches from "types" to all symbols, `*` switches from the current
workspace to dependencies.

Note that filtering does not currently work in VSCode due to the editor never
sending the special symbols to the language server. Instead, you can configure
the filtering via the `rust-analyzer.workspace.symbol.search.scope` and
`rust-analyzer.workspace.symbol.search.kind` settings.
