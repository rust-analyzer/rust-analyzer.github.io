=== Hover
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/hover.rs#L97[hover.rs]

Shows additional information, like type of an expression or documentation for definition when "focusing" code.
Focusing is usually hovering with a mouse, but can also be triggered with a shortcut.


=== Inlay Hints
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/inlay_hints.rs#L40[inlay_hints.rs]

rust-analyzer shows additional information inline with the source code.
Editors usually render this using read-only virtual text snippets interspersed with code.

rust-analyzer shows hits for

* types of local variables
* names of function arguments
* types of chained expressions

**Note:** VS Code does not have native support for inlay hints https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/16221[yet] and the hints are implemented using decorations.
This approach has limitations, the caret movement and bracket highlighting near the edges of the hint may be weird:

=== Magic Completions
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/completion.rs#L38[completion.rs]

In addition to usual reference completion, rust-analyzer provides some ✨magic✨
completions as well:

Keywords like `if`, `else` `while`, `loop` are completed with braces, and cursor
is placed at the appropriate position. Even though `if` is easy to type, you
still want to complete it, to get ` { }` for free! `return` is inserted with a
space or `;` depending on the return type of the function.

When completing a function call, `()` are automatically inserted. If a function
takes arguments, the cursor is positioned inside the parenthesis.

There are postfix completions, which can be triggered by typing something like
`foo().if`. The word after `.` determines postfix completion. Possible variants are:

- `expr.if` -> `if expr {}` or `if let ... {}` for `Option` or `Result`
- `expr.match` -> `match expr {}`
- `expr.while` -> `while expr {}` or `while let ... {}` for `Option` or `Result`
- `expr.ref` -> `&expr`
- `expr.refm` -> `&mut expr`
- `expr.not` -> `!expr`
- `expr.dbg` -> `dbg!(expr)`

There also snippet completions:

.Expressions
- `pd` -> `println!("{:?}")`
- `ppd` -> `println!("{:#?}")`

.Items
- `tfn` -> `#[test] fn f(){}`
- `tmod` ->
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_fn() {}
}
```


=== Matching Brace
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/matching_brace.rs#L3[matching_brace.rs]

If the cursor is on any brace (`<>(){}[]`) which is a part of a brace-pair,
moves cursor to the matching brace. It uses the actual parser to determine
braces, so it won't confuse generics with comparisons.

=== On Typing Assists
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/typing.rs#L35[typing.rs]

Some features trigger on typing certain characters:

- typing `let =` tries to smartly add `;` if `=` is followed by an existing expression
- Enter inside comments automatically inserts `///`
- typing `.` in a chain method call auto-indents


=== Parent Module
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/parent_module.rs#L12[parent_module.rs]

Navigates to the parent module of the current module.

**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/runnables.rs#L45[runnables.rs]

Shows a popup suggesting to run a test/benchmark/binary **at the current cursor
location**. Super useful for repeatedly running just a single test. Do bind this
to a shortcut!

=== Semantic Syntax Highlighting
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/syntax_highlighting.rs#L33[syntax_highlighting.rs]

rust-analyzer highlights the code semantically.
For example, `bar` in `foo::Bar` might be colored differently depending on whether `Bar` is an enum or a trait.
rust-analyzer does not specify colors directly, instead it assigns tag (like `struct`) and a set of modifiers (like `declaration`) to each token.
It's up to the client to map those to specific colors.

The general rule is that a reference to an entity gets colored the same way as the entity itself.
We also give special modifier for `mut` and `&mut` local variables.


=== Show Syntax Tree
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/syntax_tree.rs#L9[syntax_tree.rs]

Shows the parse tree of the current file. It exists mostly for debugging
rust-analyzer itself.

=== Structural Seach and Replace
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/ssr.rs#L26[ssr.rs]

Search and replace with named wildcards that will match any expression.
The syntax for a structural search replace command is `<search_pattern> ==>> <replace_pattern>`.
A `$<name>:expr` placeholder in the search pattern will match any expression and `$<name>` will reference it in the replacement.
Available via the command `rust-analyzer.ssr`.

```rust
// Using structural search replace command [foo($a:expr, $b:expr) ==>> ($a).foo($b)]

// BEFORE
String::from(foo(y + 5, z))

// AFTER
String::from((y + 5).foo(z))
```

=== Workspace Symbol
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide_db/src/symbol_index.rs#L113[symbol_index.rs]

Uses fuzzy-search to find types, modules and functions by name across your
project and dependencies. This is **the** most useful feature, which improves code
navigation tremendously. It mostly works on top of the built-in LSP
functionality, however `#` and `*` symbols can be used to narrow down the
search. Specifically,

- `Foo` searches for `Foo` type in the current workspace
- `foo#` searches for `foo` function in the current workspace
- `Foo*` searches for `Foo` type among dependencies, including `stdlib`
- `foo#*` searches for `foo` function among dependencies

That is, `#` switches from "types" to all symbols, `*` switches from the current
workspace to dependencies.
